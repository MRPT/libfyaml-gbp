License: GPL-2+ with AutoConf exception
    Based on the GNU General Public License, which on Debian systems can be
    found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2', with the following exception:
    .
    Autoconf Exception
    .
    As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited
    permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that are
    the output of Autoconf. You need not follow the terms of the GNU General
    Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even though
    portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU General Public
    License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material that constitutes
    the Autoconf program.
    .
    Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied
    (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of Autoconf.
    We call these the "data" portions. The rest of the Autoconf source text
    consists of comments plus executable code that decides which of the data
    portions to output in any given case. We call these comments and executable
    code the "non-data" portions. Autoconf never copies any of the non-data
    portions into its output.
    .
    This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf released
    by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and distribute a modified
    version of Autoconf, you may extend this special exception to the GPL to
    apply to your modified version as well, *unless* your modified version has
    the potential to copy into its output some of the text that was the
    non-data portion of the version that you started with. (In other words,
    unless your change moves or copies text from the non-data portions to the
    data portions.) If your modification has such potential, you must delete
    any notice of this special exception to the GPL from your modified version.

License: GPL-3+ with AutoConf exception
    Based on the GNU General Public License, which on Debian systems can be
    found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3', with the following exception:
    .
    AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION
    .
    Version 3.0, 18 August 2009
    .
    Copyright Â© 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. >http://fsf.org/<
    .
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
    document, but changing it is not allowed.
    .
    This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU
    General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file that
    bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the
    file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
    .
    The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf's typical
    output under terms of the recipient's choice (including proprietary).
    .
    0. Definitions.
    "Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf that is
    a covered work under this License.
    .
    "Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of its
    Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not from its
    input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and non-tracing
    output.
    .
    "Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.
    .
    1. Grant of Additional Permission.
    You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such
    propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3. However, if by
    modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you
    received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then
    you void this Exception for the resulting covered work. If you convey
    that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance
    with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.
    .
    2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.
    The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption
    that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the
    license of Autoconf.
